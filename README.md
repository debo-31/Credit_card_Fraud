This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It involves preprocessing transaction data, addressing class imbalance, and training models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The model is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure accurate fraud detection. The goal is to build a reliable system that can identify and flag fraudulent transactions to minimize financial losses.
